This is the LaTeX code for my bachelor thesis about the "Classification of
Loop Agreement Tasks". Since the submission date i've fixed numerous typos
and some other errors (but the print version is still availible under the
tag `print-version`).

A compiled version (as pdf) can be found here: [loop_agreement.pdf](http://homepages.uni-regensburg.de/~prj05723/_ba/loop_agreement.pdf)
<!-- The Haskell implementation, discussed in sections 4.2 and 4.3, can be found here: -->
