\section{Simplicial Complexes}
Because our mathematical model for distributed computing fundamentally relies on
\emph{simplicial complexes} this section gives a brief review of the basic
definitions and properties used in this thesis. We include this for
the sake of completeness but \emph{not} to replace a introduction on the topic
by a good text book.  You may want to consult for example (?? .. ??) % TODO
for further reading.
 
\begin{thDef}[(abstract) simplicial complex]\hfill
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Let $V$ be a set and let $K\subset\pot V$. The pair $(V,K)$ is
            an \emph{(abstract) simplicial complex} if every element of~$K$ is
            a finite set, $K$ is closed under taking subsets (i.\,e. for all
            $F\in K$ and $F'\subset F$ we have $F'\in K$) and $K$ contains
            all singleton subsets of~$V$ (i.\,e. for all $v\in V$ we have
            $\{v\}\in K$).
            
        \item
            Let $(V,K)$ be a simplicial complex. An element~$v$ of~$V$ is
            a \emph{vertex of~$K$}. An element~$F$ of~$K$ is
            a \emph{simplex (of~$K$)}, $\dim(F)\defeq\abs{F}-1
            \in\N\cup\{-1\}$ is its \emph{dimension}, and each subset of~$F$ is
            called a \emph{face of~$F$}. A simplex of dimension~$n$ is also
            called an \emph{$n$-simplex}.
            
        \item
            The \emph{dimension of $(V,K)$} is
            \[ \dim(K) \defeq \max_{F\in K} \,\dim(F) \;\in\,\N\cup\{-1,\infty\}
            \]
            whenever $K\neq\emptyset$ and $-2$ otherwise.
            
        \item
            The simplicial complex $(V,K)$ is called \emph{finite} if
            $\abs{K}$ is finite.
            
        \item
            A \emph{subcomplex of $(V,K)$} is a simplicial complex~$(V',K')$
            such that $V'\subset V$ and $K'\subset K$. For $k\in\N$ the
            subcomplex
            \[ \bigl( V,\; \{ F\in K \cMid[\,]{} \dim(F) \leq k \} \bigr) \]
            of $(V,K)$ is the \emph{$k$-skeleton of $(V,K)$}, which
            we denote by $(V,K)^{\leq k}$.
            
        \item
            Let $F$ be a simplex of~$K$. Then $K(F)$ denotes the subcomplex
            of~$(V,K)$ determined by $F$ and its faces, i.\,e.
            $K(F) = (F, \, \{ F' \Mid F'\subset F \})$.
    \end{itemize}

\begin{thConvention}\hfill
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Instead of $(V,K)$ we mostly speak of a simplicial complex~$K$ where it
            is understood that $V(K)\defeq V = \bigcup K$.
            
        \item
            Note that every simplicial complex is partially ordered by
            inclusion and we shall occasionally use this fact without
            further notice.
    \end{itemize}
\end{thConvention}

\begin{thDef}[simplicial map]
    Let $K,L$ be simplicial complexes. A \emph{simplicial map $f\colon K\to L$}
    is a map $f\colon V(K)\to V(L)$ such that simplices of~$K$ are taken to
    simplices of~$L$, i.\,e. for $F\in K$ we have $f(F) \in L$.
\end{thDef}

\begin{thDef}[category of simplicial complexes]
    Simplicial complexes together with simplicial maps (and usual function
    composition) form a category~$\Simp$.
    For $n\in\N\cup\{-1\}$ we also denote its full subcategory of
    $n$-dimensional simplicial complexes by $\Simp_n$.
\end{thDef}

\begin{thExample}[standard simplex (as a complex)]
    Let $n\in\N$. The \emph{$n$-dimensional standard simplex} is
    \[ \Delta^n \defeq \setZeroto n  . \]
    The standard simplex~$\Delta^n$ together with all its faces forms a
    simplicial complex, which (by abuse of notation) we also denote by~$\Delta^n$
    (the meaning will be clear from the context). We write $\partial\Delta^n$
    for the $(n{-}1)$-skeleton of $\Delta^n$.
\end{thExample}

\begin{thDef}[geometric standard simplex]
    Let $n\in\N$. The \emph{$n$-dimensional geometric standard simplex} is
    the convex hull of the unit vectors in~$\R^{n+1}$ (with the subspace
    topology):
    \[ \Deltageo^n \defeq \conv(e_0,\dots,e_{n}) \;\subset\,\R^{n+1} . \]
    For $J\subset\setZeroto n$ the subspace $\conv(\{e_j\Mid j\in J\})$
    of~$\Deltageo^n$ is called a \emph{face of~$\Deltageo^n$}.
\end{thDef}

\begin{thDef}[geometric realization]\hfill
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            Let $K$ be a simplicial complex. The \emph{geometric realization
            of~$K$} is the topological space
            \[ \geom{K} \defeq \coprod_{F\in K} \Deltageo^{\dim(F)}
                \,\big/\,{\sim}
            , \]
            where $\sim$ is the equivalence relation generated by the obvious
            gluing of faces that is encoded in~$K$.
            For a vertex~$v$ and a simplex~$F$ of~$K$ we denote by $\geom v$ 
            and~$\geom F$ the corresponding point and subspace of~$\geom K$,
            respectively (i.\,e. the image (point) under the canonical inclusion
            followed by the quotient map). Consequently, for a subspace
            $K'\subset K$ we write $\geom{K'}$ for $\bigcup \{ \geom{F'} \Mid
            F'\in K' \} \subset \geom K$. For $x\in\geom K$ the (unique)
            simplex~$F$ of~$K$ such that the interior of~$\geom F$ contains~$x$
            is $\supp(x) = F$.
            
        \item
            Let $K,L$ be simplicial complexes and let $f\colon K\to L$ be a
            simplicial map. Then
            \[ \geom{f}\colon\geom{K}\to\geom{L} \]
            is the continuous map obtained from~$f$ by affine extension to each
            simplex.
    \end{itemize}
\end{thDef}

\begin{thDef}[triangulation]
    Let $X$ be a topological space. Then $X$ is \emph{triangulable} if
    there exists a simplicial complex~$K$ and a homeomorphism
    $f\colon\geom{K}\to X$. Such a pair $(K,f)$ is then called
    a \emph{triangulation of~$X$}.
\end{thDef}

\begin{thDef}[barycentric subdivision]
    Let $K$ be a simplicial complex. The \emph{(first) barycentric subdivsion
    of~$K$} is the simplicial complex
    \[ \sd K  \defeq \bigl\{
            \{ F_1,\dots,F_k \} \subset K \Mid
            k\in\N, \; F_1\subsetneq\dots\subsetneq F_k
        \bigr\}
    . \]
    We set $\sd^0 K \defeq K$, $\sd^1 K \defeq \sd K$ and for $N\in\N[\geq2]$ we
    define recursively $\sdNK \defeq \sd(\sd^{N-1} K)$, the \emph{$N$-th
    barycentric subdivision of~$K$}.
\end{thDef}

\begin{thProposition}[geometric barycentric subdivision]
    Let $K$ be a simplicial complex. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item
            There exists a homeomorphism
            \[ \beta_K\colon \geom{\sd K} \to \geom{K}  , \]
            given by the affine extension to each simplex of the following map
            $\geom{(\sd K)^{\leq 0}}\to\geom{K}$: for a vertex~$v$ of $\sd K$,
            which is a simplex of~$K$, say $v = F\in K$, the point
            $\geom{v}\in\geom{\sd K}$ is mapped to the barycenter of
            $\geom F\subset\geom K$.
            
        \item
            In particular, the above homeomorphism induces a homeomorphism
            \[ \beta_K^N\colon\geom{\sdNK}\to\geom{K} \]
            for all $N\in\N[\geq1]$, and for convenience, we set
            $\beta_K^0 \defeq \id_{\geom K}$.
    \end{itemize}
\end{thProposition}

\begin{thDef}[simplicial approximation]
    Let $K,L$ be simplicial complexes and let $f_\geo\colon\geom K\to\geom L$
    be continuous.  A simplicial map $f\colon K\to L$ is a \emph{simplicial
    approximation to~$f_\geo$} if $\supp(\geom{f}(x))$ is a face of
    $\supp(f_\geo(x))$ for all $x\in\geom K$.
\end{thDef}

\begin{thTheorem}[simplicial approximation theorem]
    \label{ch1:simpapprox}
    %
    Let $K,L$ be finite simplicial complexes and let
    $f_\geo\colon\geom K\to\geom L$ be continuous.
    Then there exists an $N\in\N$ and a simplicial map $f\colon\sdNK\to L$
    such that $f$ is a simplicial approximation to
    $f_\geo\after\beta_K^N\colon\geom{\sdNK}\to\geom L$.
\end{thTheorem}

\begin{thLemma}[inclusion of subcomplex is cofibration]
    \label{ch1:inclcofibration}
    %
    Let $K$ be a simplicial complex and let $K'$ be a subcomplex
    of~$K$. Then $\geom{K'}\hookrightarrow\geom{K}$ is a cofibration.
\end{thLemma}
